# Ambry

Ambry is a database and ORM replacement for small, mostly static models. Use
it to replace database-persisted seed data and ad-hoc structures in your app or
library with plain old Ruby objects that are searchable via a fast, simple
database-like API.

It implements Active Model and has generators to integrate nicely with Rails.
You can store your data in either YAML or dump file.

For more info, take a peek at the
[docs](http://rubydoc.info/github/norman/ambry/frames), or read on for some
quick samples.

## A quick tour

```ruby
# Create a model.
class Country
  # Turn any Ruby object into a Ambry model by extending this module.
  extend Ambry::Model

  # The first field listed here will be the "primary key."
  field :tld, :name

  # Chainable filters, sort of like Active Record scopes.
  filters do
    def big
      find {|c| c.population > 100_000_000 }
    end

    def in_region(region)
      find {|c| c.region == region }
    end

    def alphabetical
      sort_by {|c| c.name }
    end
  end

  # Root filter, can be used to setup relations.
  def regions
    Region.find {|r| r.id == region }
  end

end

# create some contries
Country.create :tld => "AR", :name => "Argentina", :region => :america, :population => 40_000_000
Country.create :tld => "CA", :name => "Canada",    :region => :america, :population => 34_000_000
Country.create :tld => "JP", :name => "Japan",     :region => :asia,    :population => 127_000_000
Country.create :tld => "CN", :name => "China",     :region => :asia,    :population => 1_300_000_000
# etc.

# Do some searches
big_asian_countries         = Country.big.in_region(:asia)
countries_that_start_with_c = Country.find {|c| c.name =~ /^C/ }
# #first and #last only make sense if you run Ruby 1.9 (creation order) or explicitly specified an order
first_alphabetical          = Country.alphabetical.first
last_alphabetical           = Country.alphabetical.last
```

## When should I use Ambry?

Ambry can be useful for refactoring code with large hash constants and long case
statements. Sometimes it's hard to figure out where code ends and data begins,
but if your code looks like it could be simplified significantly by putting some
things in a data store, yet it's not enough data to justify something like
SQLite, then Ambry could be a good fit.


## Installation

    gem install ambry

## Compatibility

Ambry has been tested against these current Rubies, and is likely compatible
with others.

* Ruby 1.8.7 - 1.9.3
* Rubinius 1.2.x+
* JRuby 1.5+
